# Ellipses
## Created by Calico Randall
 
This project makes use of circles in P5.js. 

The circles are generated in the middle of the screen when hitting the "enter" key on the user's keyboard. They have a random velocity and size and move out of the center towards the edge of the screen. Their opacity is always shifting, making it look like they are flickering or gittering. When they reach the screen's edge, they stick to it and turn white.

When the mouse is pressed, all of the circles start to gravitate towards where the mouse is. When the mouse is released, they move back to the edge of the screen.
